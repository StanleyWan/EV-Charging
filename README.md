# EV-Charging
Capstone Project for UC Berkeley's Professional Certification for Machine Language and Artificial Language
## Overview
The rise of electric vehicles is one of the most exciting changes of our time. Adoption is accelerating, new models appear every year, and cities are beginning to shift their infrastructure. But in many ways, this is still just the beginning of the journey. As more drivers make the switch, the demand for charging stations grows rapidly. In some cities, this pressure is already visible—queues form at busy locations, and frustrations sometimes spill over.
This raises an important question: how do people actually use charging stations, and what can we learn to ease the strain? Not every driver behaves the same. Some “top up” only a little to make it home, others charge halfway to cover the week, and some insist on filling the battery to 100%. In my project, I use terms like Casual Driver, Commuter, and Long-Distance Driver, but these labels really point to something simpler: different patterns of human behavior.
At its heart, this study is not about the car—it is about the people. What motivates them to charge fully or partially? How do cost, time of day, battery size, or station type influence their decisions? These are the questions that guide my capstone project.
